# App description / Context

Jammming was a walk-through project created by Codecademy as part of the full-stack development module. The app makes use of Spotify API's in order for the user to search through the Spotify trach library, return relevant suggestions from a search, add to a preliminary playlist, before saving a new playlist to a user's account.

## Involvement

At the time of writing, the project was briefed with given hints and a walk-through video. The video gave strong guidance towards the more complex elements of the project, including integrating API's within a react project.
